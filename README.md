Note:
The app uses ws as the socket header instead of wss and since all GitHub Page hosted websites use HTTPS the browser will not render the app.
The work around for this is that when you load the app (Google Chrome)
1. you will have to click on the lock icon on the address bar and
2. select site settings from dropdown.
3. Under Permission scroll all the way down to find insecure content
4. Select `allow` from drop down
